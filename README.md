# Chicago Neighborhood Insights - Python/Tableau

## Project Overview
This project evaluates the quality of neighborhoods in Chicago by combining:
- **Crime Rates**
- **Education Metrics**
- **Housing Data**

The result is a **Neighborhood Quality Index (NQI)** that ranks each neighborhood from 1 (highest quality) to N (lowest).
