# Chicago Insights Dashboard - Python/Tableau

## Project Overview
Built on publicly available data, the Chicago Insights Dashboard proposed in this project intends to provide Chicago residents with insights into safety, schools, and housing value regarding their neighborhoods. Several previous projects have explored the creation of a community insights dashboard to provide average citizens with actionable insights. For example, in her thesis, Dowling develops a web-based GIS application to help residents of Anchorage, Alaska find neighborhoods that best fit their preferences based on crime rates, weather, real estate and other factors [5]. Sunkpho & Wipulanusat explored the potential value of using a Business Intelligence (BI) style dashboard, to present publicly available geospatial data [6]. While Ruiming Xu examined the effects that COVID-19 had on NYC neighborhoods [7]. These three dashboards are a few examples of previous projects utilizing publicly available data to deliver insights to average citizens. However, despite the large quantity of data available, the city of Chicago lacks a similar style dashboard.

The Chicago Community Insights Dashboard attempts to resolve this issue by creating a relational database that allows for deep, unrestricted analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of Chicago neighborhoods across multiple dimensions. The creation of the dashboard was initiated with the collection of multiple datasets covering housing, crime, and education in the Chicago metropolitan area. These datasets were transformed using Python into a consolidated table containing neighborhood scores, income scores, crime rates, and related metrics. This table was then utilized to design and develop an elegant, user-friendly dashboard using Tableau that empowers citizens to make informed decisions and learn about their neighborhoods. Included in the dashboard is a community score which is designed to evaluate neighborhood quality based on metrics from a combination of factors.

## Methodology
This database introduces a metric known as the Community Score, designed to evaluate neighborhood quality across Chicago ZIP codes using a weighted scoring model. ZIP codes are ranked from most to least desirable based on a combination of factors grouped into three primary categories: housing, education, and crime. The Community Score provides a standardized measure to assist individuals in making informed decisions about where to live, while also offering policymakers and government officials a statistical decision-making tool to identify and address areas in need of localized improvements.

In assessing community scores across different ZIP codes, housing quality was measured based on two factors: income level of homeowners and foreclosure rate. Income levels were weighted to favor areas where homeowners had higher incomes as shown in Table II. For each ZIP code, these weighted income brackets were used to calculate an overall income score, which was then incorporated as a contributing variable in the Community Score model, as shown in Table III. According to research, increases in income improve housing quality, though the effect diminishes at higher levels [17]. This diminishing return occurs because, once a baseline standard of living is achieved, individuals are less inclined to allocate additional resources toward housing investments. Furthermore, a recent study found that nearly 20% of U.S. homeowners spend over 30% of their income on housing costs, suggesting that the correlation between income and housing quality begins to plateau beyond an income threshold of approximately $100,000. As a result, the weighting increment from the $50,000â€“$100,000 income bracket to the over $100,000 bracket is modest (an increase of 1), whereas increases between other income brackets are weighted more heavily (increments of 2) [18].
